# Sales-Analysis-and-Customer-Insights-for-a-Multi-Department-Grocery-Chain
Sales Analysis Using PowerBi &amp; Excel
Overview:

A multi-department grocery chain, operating across various locations, seeks to improve its sales analysis and customer insights through data-driven methods in Microsoft Excel and PowerBI. The chain offers an extensive selection of food categories, departments, and brands. To optimize store sales, enhance customer experiences, and refine promotional strategies, the company aims to leverage data analysis. Additionally, the company desires a dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of key insights from the data.

Objective:

The primary goal of this analysis is to derive actionable insights from the sales and customer data to address the following key questions:

1. What is the total number of records (rows) in the dataset?
2. What are the unique values for the 'promotion_name' column?
3. Can you provide summary statistics for the 'store_sales' column, such as mean, median, and standard deviation?
4. How many unique values are there in the 'sales_country' column, and what are they?
5. What is the most common 'gender' in the dataset?
6. What is the average 'unit_sales' for all records in the dataset?
7. How many different 'store_types' are present, and what are they?
8. What is the distribution of 'marital_status' in the dataset?
9. Are there any missing values in the dataset, and if so, in which columns?
10. What is the range of 'avg_yearly_income' values in the dataset?

Purpose of Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to provide the grocery chain with a detailed understanding of sales performance and customer behaviors. By uncovering patterns and trends, the analysis will support strategic decision-making aimed at maximizing sales, enhancing the customer experience, and optimizing promotional efforts.

Approach:

Data Collection and Preparation: Gather and organize sales and customer data from various departments and locations. Ensure data accuracy and completeness by performing data cleaning and preprocessing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct initial analysis to explore sales trends, customer behaviors, and the effectiveness of promotions. Identify key metrics and performance indicators.

Detailed Analysis: Examine sales performance by department, location, and product category. Analyze customer purchasing patterns and the impact of marketing strategies.

Dashboard Creation: Develop an interactive dashboard in Power Bi that visualizes the key insights and metrics. Include visualizations such as charts, graphs, and pivot tables to represent sales trends, customer behavior,and promotional impact.

Actionable Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis, provide recommendations for improving sales strategies, enhancing customer experience, and optimizing promotional activities.

The analysis and dashboard will empower the grocery chain to make strategic, data-driven decisions that align with its objectives of increasing sales and improving overall business performance.
